**"AI for Mathematics" (AI4Math)** in the general sense refers to using AI, machine learning, and neural networks to solve problems in pure and applied mathematics, including AI4PDE which finds approximate solutions to partial differential equations. 

**"AI for Mathematics" (AI4Math)** in the narrow sense refers to the [neuro-symbolic approach](symbolic/) to generate candidates for mathematical proofs, until being accepted by formal verification systems like *Lean*, *Coq*, and *Isabelle*, using Large Language Models (LLMs), and (possibly "human-in-the-loop") Reinforcement Learning (RL).
